### Project Name: Student Grade Tracker

#### Overview

The **Student Grade Tracker** is a Java application designed to calculate and display a student's academic performance. It processes input marks across multiple subjects to compute total marks, percentage, and assign a corresponding grade, ensuring accurate and insightful feedback on academic achievements.

#### Features:

- **User Input Validation**: The program ensures that all input is within the valid range (0 to 100) and verifies the number of subjects entered, safeguarding against errors.
  
- **Dynamic Calculation**: Automatically calculates total marks, percentage, and grade based on the entered subject marks, providing real-time results that reflect the student's performance.
  
- **Comprehensive Grading System**: Grades are assigned based on the calculated percentage, with a clear and intuitive grading scale:
  - **A+** : 90% and above
  - **A** : 80% to 89%
  - **B** : 70% to 79%
  - **C** : 60% to 69%
  - **D** : 50% to 59%
  - **F** : Below 50%

#### How to Use:

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the total number of subjects.
3. Input the marks obtained in each subject.
4. The program will output the total marks, percentage, and grade.

#### Educational Value:

This project is an excellent introduction to core Java programming concepts, including loops, conditionals, and user input handling. It provides a practical application of these concepts, making it an ideal learning tool for beginners looking to strengthen their understanding of Java.

This **Student Grade Tracker** not only simplifies the process of grade calculation but also serves as a foundational project for aspiring Java developers.
